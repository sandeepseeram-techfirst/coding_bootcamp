# Test-Driven Development (TDD) 

Arrange-Act-Assert 

This pattern describes the setup of a test case dividing the test case into three sections:

# Arrange - All of the variables are initialized to their test values. 
- Think of this as establishing the state of the test environment.

# Act - The function under test is exercised and the result (if any) is saved for analysis.

# Assert - This section of the test contains all of the expectations for the test (ideally there should be only one). 
- This ensures that the data from the "Act" stage matches the expectations of the function.
